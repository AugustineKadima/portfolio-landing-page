                        <br>
                        <p> I am a <strong>software developement</strong>  student at Moringa school. I have a bachelor of science degree in <em>Astronomy and Astrophysics</em>  from the University of Nairobi. </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>I started learning about software development because I wanted to provide technology solutions and I did not know how to go about it. I wanted to learn the right way to do it. </p>
                        <br>  
                        <p>Moringa School seemed to be the best option for me.</p>
